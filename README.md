# ubo-filters

My personal [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/ublock) filters, that I use on Firefox.

This repo is meant to serve as a backup of all my filters, but you can also subscribe to it if you want to use the same filters.

**Warning: This filter list is extremely opinionated and blocks everything I don't want to see/load/visit online. You may not like it because of it breaking something you use frequently**

To subscribe and stay updated with all changes, click [here](https://subscribe.adblockplus.org?location=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fvishalnandagopal%2Fubo-filters%2Fmain%2Fmy-filters.txt&title=Vishal%27s%20personal%20uBO%20filter%20list).

You can also copy paste everything in the [my-filters.txt](my-filters.txt) file into the "My Filters" tab in uBlock Origin settings, but this means you won't get any changes or fixes that I put on this filter list.

## Features

- **Blocks all of Facebook everywhere**. If you use Facebook, don't add this list to uBO. I try to unbreak Instagram as much as possible tho, so it should work.
- Tries to block distracting content on most popular news sites, disables js on those sites if they work without it.
- Hides distracting elements (**and recommendations**) on YouTube, so you can just watch a video and then continue working on something else. This doesn't hide the vidoes in the playlist menu, but only hides all the suggested/recommended videos in the sidebar.
- Tries to block URL redirectors that include the destination in the URL string, so you can just click "+" on the uBlock Origin block page and then select the destination URL directly.
- Blocks Google sign-in and all prompts on third party websites, and all other social media (LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Pinterest and so on).
